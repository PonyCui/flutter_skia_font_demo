/// An iterable collection of [PathMetric] objects describing a [Path].
///
/// A [PathMetrics] object is created by using the [Path.computeMetrics] method,
/// and represents the path as it stood at the time of the call. Subsequent
/// modifications of the path do not affect the [PathMetrics] object.
///
/// Each path metric corresponds to a segment, or contour, of a path.
///
/// For example, a path consisting of a [Path.lineTo], a [Path.moveTo], and
/// another [Path.lineTo] will contain two contours and thus be represented by
/// two [PathMetric] objects.
///
/// This iterable does not memoize. Callers who need to traverse the list
/// multiple times, or who need to randomly access elements of the list, should
/// use [toList] on this object.

/// [PathMetric] objects. Callers that want to randomly access elements or
/// iterate multiple times should use `path.computeMetrics().toList()`, since
/// [PathMetrics] does not memoize.
///
/// Once created, the metrics are only valid for the path as it was specified
/// when [Path.computeMetrics] was called. If additional contours are added or
/// any contours are updated, the metrics need to be recomputed. Previously
/// created metrics will still refer to a snapshot of the path at the time they
/// were computed, rather than to the actual metrics for the new mutations to
/// the path.
